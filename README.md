# Town Sim

**Description:** A city builder! I haven't decided the theme yet, or the details. Possible medieval, fantasy, or modern. Will figure that out as I go. Resource gathering, economy, population, and ecology will all be present to some degree. Haven't decided which kind of city/base builder just yet. Probably more Sim City than Anno. But maybe a bit of both.
